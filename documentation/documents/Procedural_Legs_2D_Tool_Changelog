- added variable foot hit raycast distance
- detection range of the ground adjusted
- adjusted body y lerp velocity
- jump control refactored and improved
- jumpForce now corresponds to the force aplyied by RigdBody.AddForce()
- added jump variable "horizontalVelocityMultiplierForce"
- currentPathPoint made public for acess
- removed body reference from File classes and added method to directly get json values to body
- added helper class that uses SimpleJSON to parse needed Unity types
- fix: avoids full rotation of the foot
- fix: setting playerControllerEnable didn't work

- Legs were lerping too fast, Changed speed to pl2d_PlayerController.bodyAcceleration
- Improved ground check with legs grounded check
- PL2D_PlayerController.Move refactored to facilitate reuse and customization, added keycode parameters
- Improved Jump, added pre jump led bend time setting
- Removed bodySpeed reference from the Jump up velocity, new it depends only on jumpForce
- FlipBodyOnMousePos refactored and added FlipBody to facilitate reuse
- Fix: body occasionally getting stuck in the air if hit.transform == null
- Fix: Vertical body positioning multiplier, improved "Wall Walk" disabled movement. Recommended to use "wall walk" only for soft angled and round corners grounds.
- Fix: leg glitch on Grounded
- Fix: isJump not being true until jump end
- Fix: Angle solver type "Keep Vertical" not initializing correctly
